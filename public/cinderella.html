    <h1>Cinderella or the Little Glass Slipper</h1>
    <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
      <strong>ONCE</strong> upon a time there lived a gentleman who married
      twice. His second wife was a widow with two grown-up daughters, both
      somewhat past their prime, and this woman would have been the proudest and
      most overbearing in the world had not her daughters exactly resembled her
      with their fine airs and insolent tempers. The husband, too, had by his
      first wife a child of his own, a young daughter, and so good and so gentle
      that she promised to grow up into the living image of her dead mother, who
      had been the most lovable of women.

      >The wedding festivities were no sooner over than the stepmother began to
      show herself in her true colours. She could not endure the girl's good
      qualities, which by contrast rendered her own daughters the more odious.
      She put her to drudge at the meanest household work, and thus she and her
      precious darlings not only wreaked their spite but saved money to buy
      themselves dresses and finery. It was the child who scoured the pots and
      pans, scrubbed the floors, washed down the stairs, polished the tables,
      ironed the linen, darned the stockings, and made the beds. She herself
      slept at the top of the house in a garret, upon a wretched straw mattress,
      while her sisters had apartments of their own with inlaid floors, beds
      carved and gilded in the latest fashion, and mirrors in which they could
      see themselves from head to foot.

      >Yet they were so helpless, or rather they thought it so menial to do
      anything for themselves, that had they but a ribbon to tie, or a bow to
      adjust, or a bodice to be laced, the child must be sent for. When she came
      it was odds that they met her with a storm of abuse, in this fashion:--

      >'What do you mean, pray, by answering the bell in this state? Stand
      before the glass and look at yourself! Look at your hands--faugh! How can
      you suppose we should allow you to touch a ribbon, or even come near us,
      with such hands? Run downstairs, slut, and put yourself under the kitchen
      pump'--and so on.
    </p>

      <span style="mso-tab-count: 1"
        >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span
      >'How can I help it?' thought the poor little drudge. 'If I do not run at
      once when the bell rings, they scold me for that. Yet they ring--both of
      them together sometimes--a minute after setting me to rake out a grate and
      sift the ashes. As for looking at myself in the glass, gladly would I do
      it if they allowed me one. But they have told me that if I had a glass I
      should only waste time in front of it.'

      >She kept these thoughts to herself, however, and suffered her ill-usage
      patiently, not daring to complain to her father, who would, moreover, have
      joined with the others in chiding her, for he was wholly under his wife's
      thumb; and she had enough of chiding already. When she had done her work
      she used to creep away to the chimney-corner and seat herself among the
      cinders, and from this the household name for her came to be Cinder-slut;
      but the younger sister, who was not so ill-tempered as the elder, called
      her Cinderella. They were wise in their way to deprive her of a
      looking-glass; for in truth, and in spite of her sorry rags, Cinderella
      was a hundred times more beautiful than they with all their magnificent
      dresses.

      ><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It happened that the King's
      son gave a ball, and sent invitations through the kingdom to every person
      of quality. Our two misses were invited among the rest, for they cut a
      great figure in that part of the country. Mightily pleased they were to be
      sure with their cards of invitation, all printed in gold and stamped with
      the broad red seal of the Heir Apparent; and mightily busy they were,
      discussing what gowns and head-dresses would best become them. This meant
      more worry for Cinderella, for it was she who ironed her sisters' linen,
      goffered their tucks and frills, pleated their wristbands, pressed their
      trimmings of old lace and wrapped them away in tissue paper. A score of
      times all this lace, piece by piece, had to be unwrapped, inspected, put
      away again; and after a trying-on, all the linen had to be ironed,
      goffered, crimped, or pleated afresh for them. They could talk of nothing
      but their ball dresses.

      >'For my part,' said the elder, 'I shall wear a velvet cramoisie trimmed
      &agrave; l'Anglaise'--for she had a passion for cramoisie, and could not
      perceive how ill the colour went with her complexion. 'I had thought of
      cloth-of-gold, but there's the cost of the underskirt to be considered;
      and underskirts seem to grow dearer and dearer in these days. What a
      relief,' she went on, 'it must be to have money and not be forced to set
      one thing against another!'
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
      <span style="mso-tab-count: 1"
        >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span
      >'I,' said the younger, 'must make shift with my old underskirt; that is,
      unless I can wheedle some money out of Papa'--for so, in their affection,
      they called their stepfather. 'Cinderella can take out the worst stains
      to-morrow with a little eau-de-Cologne. I believe that, if she tries, she
      can make it look as good as new; and, at all events, it will give her
      something to do instead of wasting an afternoon. I don't pretend that I
      like wearing an old underskirt, and I hope to make dear Papa sensible of
      this; but against it I shall have the gold-flowered robe, on which I am
      determined, and my diamond stomacher, which is somewhat better than the
      common.'
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNoSpacing">

        >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span
      >'And I, of course,' said the elder, 'must wear my diamond spray. If only
      it had a ruby in the clasp instead of a sapphire! Rubies go so much better
      with cramoisie.... I suppose there is no time now to ask the jeweller to
      re-set it with a ruby.'
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
      <span style="mso-tab-count: 1"
        >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span
      >'But you don't possess a ruby, dear,' murmured her sister, who did
      possess one, and had no intention of lending it. 'And, besides, sapphires
      suit you so much better!'

      >They sent for the best milliner they could find, to build their mob-caps
      in triple tiers; and for the best hairdresser to arrange their hair; and
      their patches were supplied by the shop to which all the Quality went.
      From time to time they called up Cinderella to ask her advice, for she had
      excellent taste. Cinderella advised them perfectly, and even offered her
      services to dress their hair for them on the night of the ball. They
      accepted gladly enough.

      like to be going to the ball?'

      the like of me to be there.'

      ball!'

      >Any one but Cinderella would have pinned on their mob-caps awry; and if
      you or I had been in her place, I won't swear but that we might have
      pushed in the pins just a trifle carelessly. But she had no malice in her
      nature; she attired them to perfection, though they found fault with her
      all the while it was doing, and quite forgot to thank her when it was
      done. Let it be related, in excuse for their tempers, that they had passed
      almost two days without eating, so eager were they and excited. The most
      of this time they had spent in front of their mirrors, where they had
      broken more than a dozen laces in trying to squeeze their waists and make
      them appear more slender. They were dressed a full two hours before the
      time fixed for starting. But at length the coach arrived at the door. They
      were tucked into it with a hundred precautions, and Cinderella followed it
      with her eyes as long as she could; that is to say, until the tears rose
      and blinded them.
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
      <span style="mso-tab-count: 1"
        >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span
      >She turned away weeping, back to the house, and crept into her dear
      chimney-corner; where, being all alone in the kitchen, she could indulge
      her misery.
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
      <span style="mso-tab-count: 1"
        >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span
      >A long while she sat there. Suddenly, between two heavy sobs she looked
      up, her eyes attracted by a strange blue glow on the far side of the
      hearth: and there stood the queerest lady, who must have entered somehow
      without knocking.
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
      <span style="mso-tab-count: 1"
        >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span
      >Her powdered hair was dressed all about her head in the prettiest of
      short curls, amid which the most exquisite jewels--diamonds, and rubies,
      and emeralds--sparkled against the firelight. Her dress had wide panniers
      bulging over a skirt of lace flounces, billowy and delicate as sea-foam,
      and a stiff bodice, shaped to the narrowest waist imaginable. Jewels
      flashed all over this dress--or at least Cinderella supposed them to be
      jewels, though, on second thoughts, they might be fireflies, butterflies,
      glowworms. They seemed at any rate to be alive, and to dart from one point
      to another of her attire. Lastly, this strange lady held in her right hand
      a short wand, on the end of which trembled a pale bluish-green flame; and
      it was this which had first caught Cinderella's eye and caused her to look
      up.

      >'Good evening, child,' said the visitor in a sharp clear voice, at the
      same time nodding kindly across the firelight. 'You seem to be in trouble.
      What is the matter?'

    <p class="MsoNoSpacing">

      choked. This was all she could say for weeping.

      >'Well, then,' said the visitor, 'be a good girl, dry your tears, and I
      think it can be managed. I am your godmother, you must know, and in
      younger days your mother and I were very dear friends.' She omitted,
      perhaps purposely, to add that she was a Fairy; but Cinderella was soon to
      discover this too. 'Do you happen to have any pumpkins in the garden?' her
      godmother asked.

    <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
      <span style="mso-tab-count: 1"

      >Cinderella thought this an odd question. She could not imagine what
      pumpkins had to do with going to a ball. But she answered that there were
      plenty in the garden--a whole bed of them in fact.

      godmother pointed to the finest of all with her wand.

        >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span
      >Cinderella picked it, still wondering. Her godmother opened a fruit knife
      that had a handle of mother-of-pearl. With this she scooped out the inside
      of the fruit till only the rind was left; then she tapped it with her
      wand, and at once the pumpkin was changed into a beautiful coach all
      covered with gold.

      >Cinderella ran to look into her mouse trap, where she found six mice all
      alive. Her godmother, following, told her to lift the door of the trap a
      little way, and as the mice ran out one by one she gave each a tap with
      her wand, and each mouse turned at once into a beautiful horse--which made
      a fine team of six horses, of a lovely grey, dappled with mouse colour.

      beginning to find this great fun, 'if there isn't such a thing as a rat in
      the rat trap. We can make a coachman of him.'

      a touch he was changed into a fat coachman.

      did but touch her with her wand, and on the instant her rags were
      transformed into cloth of gold and silver, all bespangled with precious
      stones. She felt her hair creeping up into curls, and tiring and arranging
      itself in tiers, on the topmost of which a double ostrich feather grew
      from a diamond clasp that caught the rays of the old lady's wand and shot
      them about the garden, this way and that, making the slugs and snails
      crawl to shelter.

      approval, 'is to be well shod,' and so saying she pulled out a pair of
      glass slippers, into which Cinderella poked her toes doubtfully, for glass
      is not as a rule an accommodating material for slippers. You have to be
      measured very carefully for it.

      If you over-stay the stroke of twelve, your coach will become but a
      pumpkin again, your horses will change back into mice, your footmen into

      the royal gardens, over which shone the same stars which had looked down
      upon Cinderella's pumpkins, the ball was at its height: with scores and
      scores of couples dancing on the waxed floor to the music of the violins;
      and under the trees, where the music throbbed in faint echoes, other
      scores of couples moving, passing and repassing, listening to the plash of
      the fountains and inhaling the sweet scent of the flowers.

      Princess and of very high dignity cannot be doubted. Apart from her beauty
      and the perfection of her address (of which your Royal Highness, perhaps,
      will allow me to be no mean judge), I may mention that the very jewels in
      her hair are worth a whole province.'

      her down from the coach, and led her through the gardens, where the guests
      drew apart and gazed in wonder at her loveliness. Still escorted by him
      she entered the ball-room, where at once a great silence fell, the dancing
      was broken off, the violins ceased to play--so taken, so ravished was
      everybody by the vision of this unknown one. Everywhere ran the murmur,
      'Ah! how beautiful she is!' The King himself, old as he was, could not
      take his eyes off her, and confided to the Queen in a low voice that it
      was long since he had seen so adorable a creature.

      a score of things to tell when her sisters' coach rumbled up to the gate,
      and almost at once there came a loud ring at the bell. She stared and

      that hardly needs to be considered when you can turn pumpkins into gilt
      coaches, cobwebs into Valenciennes lace, and beetles' wings into rubies,
      with the tap of a wand.

      arrived. Throughout the evening he never left her side, nor ceased to make
      pretty speeches; and she, pretty maid, was far from finding his behaviour
      tiresome--so far, indeed, that she forgot her godmother's warning. The end
      was, that in the midst of a dance she heard the stroke of a clock, looked
      up, was dismayed to find it the first stroke of twelve when she believed
      it yet an hour short of midnight, and made her escape as lightly as a
      deer. The Prince followed, but could not catch her. Only she dropped one
      of her glass slippers, which he picked up and treasured.

      poor Cinderella, barefoot now as well as in rags, panted homeward over
      roads where the flints cut her until she bled, and the owls and great
      moths blundered out of the bushes against her face. To make matters worse,
      a thunderstorm broke before she had ran half the distance, and she arrived
      home in a terrible plight, muddy, drenched to the skin, and almost more
      dead than alive. In one thing only she was fortunate: she had outstripped
      her sisters, whose coach on the way home lost a wheel--and I have a
      suspicion that Cinderella's godmother had something to do with this
      misadventure too.

      them if they had again found the ball enjoyable, and if the beautiful lady
      had been there. They told her yes; but that on the stroke of twelve she
      had taken flight, and so hurriedly that she had let fall one of her small
      glass slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King's son had
      picked up. They added, that this indeed was the first cause of their
      delay; for, seeking their carriage, they had found the entry blocked, and
      the Prince in the wildest state of mind, demanding of the guards if they
      had not seen a Princess pass out. The guards answered that they had seen
      no one pass out but a ragged girl, who looked more like a country wench
      than a Princess. Amid this to-do, the sisters had with difficulty found
      their coach; and then, within two miles of home, a wheel had come off and
      the coach had lurched over, in a thunderstorm, too; and they had been
      forced to walk the rest of the way, the one with a bruised shoulder, and
      the other (which was worse) with a twisted ankle. But, after all, the
      dance had been worth these mischances and sufferings; and, said they,
      harking back, the Prince was undoubtedly deep in love, for they had left
      him gazing fondly at the slipper, and little doubt--mysteriously as she
      chose to behave--he would make every effort to find the beautiful creature

      and seeing how good-looking she was, said that it was but just--he had
      orders to try it upon every one.

      >He asked Cinderella to sit down, and drawing the slipper upon her little
      foot, he saw that it went on easily, and fitted the foot like wax. Great
      was the astonishment of the two sisters; but it was greater when
      Cinderella pulled from her pocket the other little slipper and put it upon
      the other foot. On top of this came a rap at the door, and in walked the
      Fairy Godmother, who, by a touch of her wand upon Cinderella's clothes,
      made them still more magnificent than they had been before.

      >And now her two sisters knew Cinderella to be the same beautiful creature
      they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet, begging her
      pardon for all the ill-usage they had made her suffer. Cinderella raised
      and kissed them, saying that she forgave them with all her heart, and
      entreated them to be loving to her always.

      >They led her to the young Prince, arrayed as she was. He thought her
      lovelier than ever, and, a few days after, they were married. Cinderella,
      who was as good as she was beautiful, lodged her two sisters in the
      palace, and married them that same day to two great Lords of the Court.
